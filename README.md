# PRODIGY_WD_TASK01(Headphone Landing Page)

Check out the headphone landing page I created for my internship! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed a user-friendly and visually appealing page. It showcases all the cool features of the headphones, includes customer reviews, and has interactive elements to keep visitors engaged. This project highlights my skills in web development and my ability to create engaging content for users.
